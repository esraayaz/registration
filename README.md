🐣 In this project, I worked on a controlled form component.

⭐️ The form cannot be completed unless it is filled out completely and correctly.
⭐️ The password must be created in a secure and strong manner; names and surnames are not accepted, repeated letters are not allowed, and a strong password must be created using special characters.
⭐️ After the form is completed correctly, a message is displayed indicating that the form has been created, and all information is reset.
